## ðŸ“Š Architecture & Database Schema

This project follows a classic static website architecture, where the user's browser directly loads HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. Content is primarily served from static files, with dynamic interactivity managed client-side. There is no traditional backend database; data like skills and projects are stored in flat JSON files, loaded and rendered by JavaScript.

    A["User Browser"] --> B["Loads index.html"];
    B --> C["Loads assests/css/style.css"];
    B --> D["Loads assests/js/app.js"];
    B --> E["Loads assests/js/particles.min.js"];
    D --> F{"Fetch Data"};
    F -- "Skills" --> G["skills.json"];
    F -- "Projects" --> H["projects/projects.json"];
    D --> I["Render Dynamic Content"];
    I --> J{"User Interaction"};

    J -- "Navigate to Projects" --> L["projects/index.html"];
    J -- "Download Resume" --> M["assests/resume.pdf"];
    J -- "Broken Link" --> N["404.html"];
```
